# Search Ghibli

---

## Description

Search Ghibli is an App built using HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT within the REACT framework as well as REACT ROUTE.  This app retrives data from the Studio Ghibli API (https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com). The user enters input into the input field to search for a Studio Ghibli movie. The App retrieves any matching movies from the api along with accompanying data about that movie.

## Stretch goals

I want the user to be able to widen their search parameters by searching for any particular character or association of a Stdio Ghibli film and retrieve selected data related to that particular character or other aspect of those films. I would like to feature animations and background images relating to studio Ghibli films which are only retrived when the associated film or other data is searched for. I would also want to include a Ghibli based game based on the searched data.
